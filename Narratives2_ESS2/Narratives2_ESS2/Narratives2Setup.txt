How to run .wav visualization code:

1. download and install processing: https://processing.org/download/
2. download the Narratives2_ESS2.zip file I have uploaded to our Facebook group 
3. unpack the Narratives2_ESS2.zip file, it will make a folder called Narratives2_ESS2
4. Open the processing IDE
5. in the processing IDE, open the file Narratives2_ESS2/Narratives2_ESS2/Narratives2_ESS2.pde
6. in the processing IDE, from options on top bar select Sketch->Add File
select the file: Narratives2_ESS2/Narratives2_ESS2/lib/Ess/library/Ess.jar and click Open
7. You should now be able to click on the Run button (play icon) in the IDE and run the beethoven-5th.wav file that was included in the zip file

8. The .wav file is specified on line 34 of the Narratives2_ESS2.pde you opened in the IDE
The file is located in the Narratives2_ESS2/Narratives2_ESS2/data/ directory
This is where you can substitute your own file

9. To export the app as an executable script, click on the Export Application button in the IDE
This creates an executable that you can click on and run: Narratives2_ESS2/Narratives2_ESS2/application.linux64/Narratives2_ESS2

This was done on 64 bit Linux
